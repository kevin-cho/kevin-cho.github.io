# kevincho.ca

Kevin Cho's personal site: an introduction, links (GitHub, LinkedIn, email, resume), and a list of apps.

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (App Router), React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## How it fits together

- **This repo is the portal.** It holds the home page, lists the apps, and routes each app's path to it.
- **Each app lives in its own repo** and its own Vercel project, and is served under a path of `kevincho.ca` (e.g. `kevincho.ca/todo`) using [Next.js Multi-Zones](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/multi-zones). Apps deploy independently.

## Adding an app

1. In the app's repo, set its base path to its URL path (for Next.js, `basePath: "/todo"` in `next.config.ts`), and deploy it as its own Vercel project.
2. In this repo, add a rewrite in `next.config.ts` that sends `/todo` and `/todo/*` to the app's Vercel deployment. (Not set up yet; it will be added with the first app.)
3. Add an entry to [`src/data/apps.ts`](src/data/apps.ts):

   ```ts
   { name: "Todo", description: "A simple todo list", url: "/todo" },
   ```

App paths must not clash with this site's own pages.

The home page shows an "Apps" section as soon as the list has at least one entry.

## Development

Requires Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`; with nvm, run `nvm use`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:3000
npm run build   # production build
npm run lint
```

If a CSS change doesn't show up in the dev server, stop it, delete the `.next/` folder, and start it again.

## Project layout

- `src/app/` — pages, root layout, global styles (`globals.css` defines the light/dark color roles)
- `src/components/` — UI pieces (theme toggle, app list, icons)
- `src/data/apps.ts` — the apps listed on the home page
- `public/` — static files (resume PDF, photo)
- `docs/plans/` — step-by-step plans and their change logs
